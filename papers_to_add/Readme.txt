TABULAR

- MAIRE
Extension of Anchor to be applied on continuous
data without the need for binning or discretization by formulating to find the optimal orthotope that explains the prediction of a given test instance

- CERTIFAI
Both for tabular and images (in theory any type, but these two were tested).
They propose a framework for interpretability, fairness and robusteness. It is a model agnostic approach, tailored for any kind of input data, that outputs counterfactual explanations. 
They also introduce CERScore, a metric to evaluate the robusteness of the models without knowing the internals of the model.

- INVASE
Similar to L2X but with different selectors
