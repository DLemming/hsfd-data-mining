Influence functions
- To identify the points (of an image) most representative for a given prediction, this method exploits influence functions ( a concept derived from statistics). They propose an algorithm that approximates the true value of the influence functions, able to work even for non-covex and non-differentiable models. They propose this method to understand the model behaviour and for debugging. They also show how to exploit the information obtained from this method to create an attack dataset for adversarial attacks.
